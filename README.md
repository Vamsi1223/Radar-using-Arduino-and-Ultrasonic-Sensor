# Radar-using-Arduino-and-Ultrasonic-Sensor
# Introduction
This Project is basically about a Radar, which can detect obstacles using Ultrasonic Waves. Radar Technology usage increased rapidly now-a-days.
Radar is an object detection system which uses radio waves to determine the 
range, altitude, direction, or speed of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, 
ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and 
terrain. The radar dish or antenna transmits pulses of radio waves or micro 
waves which bounce off any object in their path. The object returns a tiny part of 
the wave's energy to a dish or antenna which is usually located at the same site 
as the transmitter

# How Does Radar using Arduino Works?

The ultrasonic sensor rotates with the servo motor and transmitted the ultrasonic waves during this time. and the whole time a graph interface make in the simulation software. and if any object comes under the range of the ultrasonic sensor it starts to detect the object. at that time the graph interface inside the software becomes red in the object area. ultrasonic sensor work as an object detector in this project. Radar using ultrasonic sensor works in software makes the reaction according to the waves received.Ultrasonic sensors have two terminals one is a transmitter and another is the receiver. The transmitter terminal is known as the Trigger and the receiver terminal is known as the echo. Arduino continuously gives a command to the Servo motor to rotate. and the transmitter transmits the signal parallelly likewise the software also makes the graph. The ultrasonic sensor gave a different signal to the Arduino if anything comes in the path. then Arduino notifies the software for the affected region. the project depends on the ultrasonic sensor working. 


# Conclusion
Numerous advanced control methods gave designers to have more command 
over different advanced applications. In our paper, the recommended mapping 
method of whole system is assessed on small principles or scale. The field that 
we have chosen for our design “Radar System” is a very vast field and future 
scope of this technology is very high. We have tremendous applications in 
which radar system have been implemented or used. There is a lot of future 
scope of this design because of its security capacity. It can be used in many
applications. This framework can also be developed or modified according to the rising 
needs and demand.


# Future Scope
We have represented a project on Radar using Ultrasonic Sensor for human or 
object interference in short range. There is a lot future scope of this project as 
modification with Wifi connection between Arduino and Android can be 
introduced in order to monitoring through internet.
21
GPS can be introduced for security purpose. The project can be developed and
modified according to the rising need and demands.
